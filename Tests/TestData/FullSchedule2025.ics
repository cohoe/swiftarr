SUMMARY:Speed Meeting
DESCRIPTION:Are you anxious about being on a big boat with a bunch of strangers? What if they WEREN'T strangers - but the friends in this friendSHIP! FRIENDSHIP ASSEMBLE! Speed Meeting is a facilitated and casually structured event that allows you to cross that barrier and meet new people! If you are new to cruise or an established JocoNaut\, Speed Meeting is the event for you. Come one\, come all\, come at the start or even later…you are very welcome! How it works: The event usually runs for 1.5 hours and contains up to 6 rounds of chatting in groups of about 4. In each 12-15 minute round\, you'll have the opportunity to meet a handful of folks who will become familiar faces for the whole cruise! Have no fear of awkward silence - conversation prompts will be provided for you.

SUMMARY:Pink Pony Pride Party
DESCRIPTION:From party host Drew: JoCo Cruise could use a Pride party more than ever this year. There are many questions and few answers. Lucky for us\, pink ponies—and ponies in general—cannot understand such questions and do not need answers: they are focused on being pretty\, and on friendship\, and on their indivisibility from the wordless stream of pure being. So\, treat yourself to a night at the Pink Pony Club\, where you can keep on dancing as long as you like\, but at some point the others will go to bed. The theme for this year is Chappell Roan's summer bop\, "Pink Pony Club\," the idea of Pink Ponies in the most general possible way please be creative\, and also the phrase "TBDQIA" which was the original theme we announced. So come as you are: doused in mud\, soaked in glitter\, as you want you to be. Neiiighh!

DESCRIPTION:2025 is shaping up to be an inflection point for journalism in the United States: Journalists are fewer and expected to do more with less\, billionaire owners are intruding on the newsroom more frequently\, and the new administration is going to challenge the right to a free press more than the administrations before it. At the same time there is the growth of new models of publication and funding\, non-profit newsrooms\, and scrappy startups focused on local news. Where are we now? Where is it going? And what will a “free press” look like in the near future?
